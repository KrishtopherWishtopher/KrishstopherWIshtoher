        <h3>When is the best time to sell my home?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The best time of the year to sell your home is during the spring and summer months.</li>
        <li>According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), transactions during May, June, July, and August make up about 40% of annual home sales. And homes that sell in June and July typically sell for a higher price than homes sold in other months. </li>
        <li>Studies have also shown that listing your home on a Thursday can lead to faster sales, as it gives agents time to schedule showings before the weekend. </li>
        <li>In a seller's market, demand for homes exceeds the number of homes available to sell. These conditions lead to higher home prices and greater leverage for the seller. Buyers may be willing to pay more than the list price, and bidding wars over a home may even break out. </li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>How can I sell my home quickly?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stage your home. Move some furniture into storage to make the home appear roomier. Remove personal items such as family portraits so potential buyers can imagine themselves in the home.</li>
            <li>Hire a real estate agent. A real estate agent's experience and local knowledge can influence the speed of a sale. If you're worried about the cost of an agent, luckily, there are ways to save on commissions, too.</li>
            <li>Price your home appropriately. Price is one of the most important factors for buyers when searching for a home. A real estate agent can help you navigate the market conditions and determine the right price to sell quickly.</li>
            <li>Showcase what makes your home unique. What does your home have that other homes don't? Built-in bookshelves? A picturesque view? A sunlit family room? Hire a professional photographer to photograph your house. Consider having a 3D tour of your home made.</li>
            <li>Make necessary repairs. Fix any problems that will be red flags for buyers before listing the home. A real estate agent can help you identify major issues and what you might let slide.</li>
            <li>Companies that buy homes for cash, such as Opendoor and Zillow Offers, may purchase your home quickly, but you'll almost certainly have to settle for a much lower price, and even potentially pay a fee for the convenience.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>How does my agent get paid?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The seller pays for the agents' commission based on the final selling price of the home. </li>
            <li>Typically, the selling agent and the buying agent split the commission (usually 6% of the sale price of the home), with half going to each. </li>
            <li>The buying agent and the selling agent each split half of their take with their brokerage. Part of everyone's cut is used to cover the costs of business, like advertising, MLS fees, insurance, and licensing.</li>
            <li>Most agents don't get paid a salary and work on commission; they only get paid when the home sells. This model incentivizes the selling agent to sell the home for the highest price possible, which also benefits you, the seller.</li>
            <li>Sellers and agents negotiate the commission up front and write it into a contract at the beginning of the selling process. While the 6% commission is standard, it's not set in stone.</li>
            <li>Some agents negotiate their commission if they can make up the difference in other ways, such as taking advantage of a market with higher home values. Agents may also choose to discount their commission in exchange for dropping some of their usual services, like marketing campaigns.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Why is my home's market value different from its assessed value?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Market conditions determine your home's market value, while the appraised or assessed value is calculated by a professional and used for mortgage or tax purposes.</li>
            <li>Your home's value on the market is largely determined by what people are willing to pay for it. This number varies based on the number of homes available and other economic factors.</li>
            <li>Appraisals are used to determine the value of the property for mortgage insurance purposes, based on the condition and location of a property. Licensed appraisers look at the structural integrity of the home, recent renovations, and comparable home sales to determine this value. </li>
            <li>Tax assessors work for local governments and value real estate for property tax purposes. They usually assess the value of homes not individually, but neighborhood by neighborhood. Homeowners generally don't want their property to be assessed for too much because it means they'll pay higher property taxes. </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>How should I prepare my home to sell?</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The most important things to do to your home itself are cost-effective repairs and design changes that make your home feel neutral and spacious. These changes can include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Painting the interior</li>
                    <li>Installing new kitchen hardware</li>
                    <li>Power washing the exterior of the home</li>
                    <li>Moving infrequently used items to storage to declutter</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Every change you make should add more to the value of your home than it costs. Otherwise, it's not worth your time and effort. </li>
            <li>Major repairs and renovations aren't likely to be worth it, but this isn't a universal rule. Consulting with a real estate agent can help you determine what makes the most sense for your home.</li>
        </ul>
