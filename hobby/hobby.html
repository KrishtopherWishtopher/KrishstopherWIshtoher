            <h2>Home(what)</h2>
            <p>Reading as a hobby is the act of opening a book or a e-reader or anything that can display text really, and reading for a set amount of time. Most people who read for pleasure usually will read around 30 minutes to an hour a day. Some will read for shorter and some will read for longer. This is an interesting hobby and I believe that reading has benefitted my life in plenty of ways. Most of my favorite stories are books and I find that movies, tv shows, music, etc don't have nearly the same qualities that books do. I feel that when I read for pleasure I am gaining something, wheather it be more insight into the world or myself.</p>

            <h2>Best times to read</h2>
            <p>So "When" are the best times to read? It's truly different from person to person. I like to read during the night time but I know some people enjoy reading during the mornings. To be honest it really does depend so I'll try and break down what I view as the pros and cons of Reading during the Morning vs the Night.</p>

                            <li>Your less consentrated so you might just drop the book altogether</li>

        <p>Personally I am still a fan of reading at night. With that being said I have decided that I will try reading in the morning so I can try and build a healthy morning routine. I find it hard to get up sometimes and I think that if I made reading a priorty during the day time rather than at night I could motivate myself to wake up. Only time will tell though!</p>

            <h2>Where should you read?</h2>
            <p>One important part of reading is the places where you read! Sometimes I really enjoy reading outside, so i'll make it a sort of trip for me. I'll take time out and prepare a sandwhich, fill up a water bottle or buy a soda, and then I'll walk to some part of the UNCC campus and I'll sit and read. I usually look for places that don't have many people about but I know some people don't mind and will read out in public. Once again its just up to what you prefer.</p>
            <p>You can also read at home! I find that I enjoy moving around my dorm alot when I read. For example I might start in my room but than move to the couch, than to the lobby, or to some other place. I think it helps keep me active and invested in the characters or plots of what i'm reading. If you don't like moving around than more power to you but I personally don't like staying in the same place reading for over an hour. </p>
            <p>Do you prefer to read inside or outside?</p>

            <h2>How to get started</h2>
            <p>Getting started with reading might be tough! Its alright, any habit that you start to form is going to initally be hard. Over time reading will get easier but right now I have some advice for getting started!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Judge the book by its cover: We live in a time where people want to be "fresh" and "new" you're going to hear from some form of social media about certain books that you "just need!" to read. I don't think you should even pay attention to any of those suggestions. I believe you should just walk into a local bookstore and just browse, look at the covers, read the back, read the first page, do whatever you want to, but DO NOT look online for reviews.</li>
                <li>You don't have to like it: If you pick a book and you don't like it, you can easily just put it down. I understand that somethings are popular and you may feel pressured to read them, but I think its more important to just get started first, you can worry about reading what everyone else has later! You'll also feel that because you've started reading that you have to finish. This isn't true and I recommend putting down a book if you don't like the first 3rd of it.</li>
                <li>Be sincere: If you choose reading to be a hobby I think its important to be sincere about it. When you start reading a book it might feel weird to get absorbed in the writing style or care about the message of a book, but I find that this is a fun part of reading and that being sincere about the hobby is the best way to get started, be truthful about what you think about a book and don't be afraid to share you're opinions about it!</li>
            </ul>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>This is from a used bookstore. So many people were forced to buy Farenheit 451 and because they weren't interested in it they sold it to this bookstore rather then keep it. There are 5 bookshelves just like this one filled with copies of Farenheit and because they have so much supply each book is worth around a $1.</figcaption>

            <h2>The "Why"</h2>
            <p>So "why" should you read? You should read because it is (in my opinion) the most fulfilling hobby. It helps to keep my focused and relaxed; and I find that I've learned a lot about myself and things around me through reading. If you're interested in learning about history than there are books for that, if you want to read historical stories about knights in shinining armor, there are books for that, and if you want to read personal stories that authors have crafted to make statments about things that they find interesting, there are books like that aswell.</p>
